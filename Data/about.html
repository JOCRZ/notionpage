  <p class="lead">Hi listeners! </p>

  <p>This Journey began because one of my favorite audiobook channels on YouTube, <strong>@anyaaudiobook9931</strong>, suddenly got banned.<br> I used to listen to novels there every day, and when it disappeared, it genuinely affected me because audiobooks had become a big part of my life.</p>

 <p>To understand why it mattered so much, you need to know how I ended up here.</p>

  <p>I’ve never been a person who enjoys reading.<br> I’ve always preferred listening and watching.<br> My media journey began with cartoons, which evolved into movies, especially mind-bending films and investigation thrillers.
  </p>

  <p>One day, I accidentally downloaded a TV series from Telegram. I thought it was a movie because the file was packed with episodes. Turns out, it was <strong>Stranger Things</strong>. That mistake launched my binge-watching era. I got totally hooked and devoured most of the popular shows out there.</p>

  <p>This path unexpectedly led me to anime.<br>
    My first anime was <strong>Death Note</strong>, purely because it fit my love for psychological and investigative stories. I had zero expectations  like many people, <br>I used to think anime was <strong>“Just cartoons”</strong>.
   </p>

   <p><strong>Death Note</strong> changed that perception.<br>
    Still, I wasn’t fully hooked until a school friend recommended Haikyuu. Giving it a chance was one of the best decisions I ever made. <br>I had never felt that level of excitement and happiness from any show before.
    </p>

    <p>I was so excited that I literally ran to my cousin’s house just to tell her about it. Of course, she also said what everyone says: <strong>“It’s just a cartoon.”</strong><br>
      But she listened  and that meant a lot.<br> Happiness always grows when it’s shared.
     </p>

     <p>After that, I watched anime for years. I practically abandoned other types of media.<br> My cousins would joke, telling me to <strong>“watch what humans watch,”</strong> but only true anime watchers understand the depth of emotions these stories give.<br> Some feelings can never be explained, only experienced.
    </p>
    <p>As a kid, I used to watch Doraemon and Ninja Hattori without knowing they were anime.</p>

    <p>Anime became a huge part of my life. <br>I caught up with the Big 3.<br> Naruto holds a special place in my heart. <br> And watching <strong>One Piece</strong> felt as if I had lived an entirely different lifetime.</p>

    <p>I believe some of the greatest creative works ever made come from the Anime Industry.
    </p>
    <p>But over the years, the binge-watching excitement slowly faded, and I shifted to being a weekly viewer. I kept looking for that same high again.
    </p>
    <p>That search led me to Solo Leveling and Vagabond, my first manhwa and manga.<br> Then I discovered Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint  and that changed everything.
    </p>
    <p>With Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, I couldn’t wait.<br> After hitting a cliff-hanger, I immediately switched to the web novel.<br> I had no idea so many of my favorite anime and manhwa were originally adapted from novels.
    </p>
    <p>I had only read non-fiction out of curiosity, but ORV pulled me in  even though I was using a very basic built-in TTS voice.</p> 
    <p>Then I discovered audiobooks on YouTube. There weren’t many good ones for ORV, so I tried Shadow Slave first because it was highly rated on the novel site I used.
    </p> 
    <p>I instantly got attached to Sunny as a character  the same way I once rooted for Naruto. 
      The depth of storytelling blew me away.
      </p> 
    <p>And then it happened…
      The channel got banned.
     </p> 
    <p>Not just the novel I was following  but multiple playlists I wanted to explore someday. I genuinely felt depressed that day. I searched everywhere but couldn’t find a narrator or TTS voice that felt right.
    </p> 
    <p>That’s when a thought hit me <br> Why not create my own audiobook? </p>
   
    <p>I researched different tools. Most good TTS systems were paid, but ElevenLabs had a usable free tier. I decided to test it by narrating Reverend Insanity because of the hype. I recorded the files and saved them.
    </p> 
    <p>Later, I faced storage issues and thought about deleting them. But instead, I decided to upload them to YouTube  simply as a backup.
    </p> 
    <p>And that one small decision created this channel.
    </p> 
    <p>Novel WaveHz didn’t start as a YouTube dream.
      It started as a place to store files.
     </p> 
    <p>But it eventually helped me stay consistent, enjoy the novels, and share the stories I love.</p> 
    <p>That’s how this journey began.<br>
      And if you’re here reading this.
      Thank you for being part of it.
      This channel exists because of a banned audiobook.
